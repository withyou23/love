    <p> <em> "The best part of my day is your smile.
Being with you is the easiest choice I have ever made, and I’m so lucky I get to make it every day.
I love you more every day.
I love your honesty, your passion, your resilience, your courage, your partnership, and your smile.
As we grow separately, we also grow together, and it’s truly a privilege.
You’re my soulmate, my best friend, my partner, and my confidante. Thank you for that.
I want to be your favorite hello and your hardest goodbye."</em></p>
